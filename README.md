# tacticalTroops

This project was created for a data challenge [https://knowledgepit.ml/predicting-victories-in-video-games/]. The goal is to predict the winner in strategic video game - the Tactical Troops: Anthracite Shif. The alghoritm is supposed to analyse logits from multiplayer games. Each game is played by 2 players.
What makes my solution unique, is that it uses Apriori alghoritm to check effectiveness of particular weapon or unit on a particular map. All retrieved and encoded information is put into neural network. I've also tried diffrent alghoritms as KNN-Classifier, but neural networks performs slighlty better.
